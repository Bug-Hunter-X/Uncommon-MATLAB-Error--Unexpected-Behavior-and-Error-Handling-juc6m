This repository contains a MATLAB function demonstrating an uncommon error scenario involving both explicit error handling and implicit, unexpected behavior. The `bug.m` file showcases the problematic code, while `bugSolution.m` provides a corrected version with improved error handling and prevention of potential division by zero.  The error in `bug.m` could lead to program crashes for negative input values and unpredictable outcomes near x=5. The solution improves the code's reliability and robustness.
